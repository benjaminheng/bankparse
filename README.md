# bankparse

This is an experimental project to parse bank transactions and categorize them.
I plan to use it for budgeting purposes.

Unfortunately, Singapore banks don't provide well structured transaction data.
It's usually in the form of csv files formatted with varying levels of quality.
In some cases a csv file isn't even provided (DBS credit card statements). This
program intends to provide a workaround for the banks' shortcomings.
